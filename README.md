# Godot Pong

This projet is my first real attempt to use Godot for development work, probably not ideal Godot code, but it is functional and scores a game of pong. Default keybindings are control to move the left paddle up and the up arrow for the right paddle. In this version of pong, your paddle is affected by gravity and you can only control the upward movement! Gravity pulls you back down to the ground
